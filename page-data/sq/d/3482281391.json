I work at Chicago Mastering Service where I’ve mastered albums for artists on labels like Sub Pop, Matador, ANTI-, Car Park, Sacred Bones, Numero Group, Fire Talk, and International Anthem to name a few. I track and mix records too. In addition to my studio work, I have traveled the country as a front of house engineer and tour manager for the likes of Jessica Pratt, Protomartyr, Yard Act, La Luz, and more. In my free time, I play guitar and sing in the band Stuck. This website showcases a limited discography of projects I’ve had the pleasure of working on. I would love to work on yours too!"},"tagline":"Cool guy with neat skills.","email":"gregobis@gmail.com","socialMedia":[{"url":"https://www.instagram.com/guy_pidgeotto/","fontAwesomeIcon":"FaInstagram"},{"url":"https://twitter.com/itchywizard","fontAwesomeIcon":"FaTwitter"},{"url":"https://bsky.app/profile/guypidgeotto.bsky.social","fontAwesomeIcon":"FaBluesky"},{"url":"https://livelaughlufs.substack.com/","fontAwesomeIcon":"FaBookmark"}]}]}}}
